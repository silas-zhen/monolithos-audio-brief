# Audio Brief by Monolithos

**Turn your notes into podcasts. One click.**

Your research paper becomes a 12-minute detective duo dissecting every argument.
Your business plan becomes a boardroom debate between two brutal advisors.
Your journal becomes a comedy roast that makes you laugh at your own existential crisis.

This is not text-to-speech. This is AI-generated conversation with personality, drama, and insight.

## What It Does

Select any note in your vault. Choose a mode. Press TRANSMIT.
Audio Brief generates a full podcast-style conversation — two AI hosts
analyzing, debating, and riffing on your content.

The audio plays right inside Obsidian. Download it. Listen on your commute.
Share it with your team. A full transcript auto-saves as `.md` in your vault.
